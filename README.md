# Peer-Graded-Assignment
This is a peer graded assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data in R. 

# Procedure 
In order to accomplish what I have done proceed as follows:

i. First create a project in R and name it PeerGradedAssignment. Ensure that it is tracked using git.
ii. Create a an R script that will intern create the necessary folders that we may need (data, scripts, graphs, figures)
iii. Neatly write the run_analysis.R script that will do the job. Ensure that you do it well that the entire process is reproducible

# Reproducibilty
We did not touch on the source of the data as that is included in the script. Pulls data from the server then do the analysis.

# Final product

1. We will end up with two datasets as required:
The final dataset is named test_train and the aggregated dataset is named test_train2

2. Codebook that expalins the variables in the dataset
